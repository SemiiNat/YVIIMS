# YVIIMS

## Capstone Project

This repository contains our capstone project: an Inventory Management System (IMS) integrated with the Lazada API. The system is designed to streamline and automate inventory management processes.

### Features
- **Lazada API Integration**: Our IMS is integrated with the Lazada API to facilitate seamless synchronization of inventory data.
- **Under Development**: We are currently developing a Decision Support System (DSS) feature to enhance the capabilities of our IMS.

### Note
Due to time constraints, the system is still under active development and not all planned features are fully implemented.

### Future Work
- Completion and enhancement of the DSS feature.
- Additional improvements and optimizations based on user feedback and testing.

We appreciate your understanding as we continue to work on and improve this project.
